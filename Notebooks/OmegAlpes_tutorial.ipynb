At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to simulate various kind of scenarios depending on your need. Some scenarios you will learn in this tutorial:\n    \n    - Cost constraints\n    - Storage integration\n    - Multiple energy model (heat and electricity)\n\n    Before we start, let's get familiar with the case study we are going to work on.\n    \n[`[Study case]` Video](https://www.powtoon.com/embed/e3P9hvlJPb7/ \"Click to watch the video!\")\n    \n      \n     Let's get started with modelling his home !\n   \n\n`[Tutorial 1]` <a href=\"./Notebooks/OmegAlpes_Tutorial_1.ipynb\">Home Modelling</a><br><br>\n    "},{"metadata":{"heading_collapsed":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <font color=blue>Optimisation simulation\n    \n    After finishing tutorial 1, you already cleared the first level of this tutorial.

General understanding of the model components\n    You acquired the skill to make basic energy units. Level up your skill in Tutorial 2 to acquire the ability to add vari-ety of useful components, such as battery and shiftable load ! With these additions into the model, you can help John   save more energy.\n\n<img src=\"./Resources/tutorial2.JPG\" width=\"550\" height=\"150\" >\n    \n     To level up this skill :\n`[Tutorial 2 Level 2] :` <a href=\"./Notebooks/OmegAlpes_Tutorial_2.ipynb\">Tutorial 2 - Battery and Shiftable consumption</a><br><br>\n\n    2. Model an energy system with OmegAlpes\n    You acquired the skill to model a simple energy system with electricity. Level up your skill in Tutorial 3 to acquire the ability to add thermal energy into your model.

Processing optimisation result\n    You acquired the skill to optimize result with one objective (minimize grid import). Level up your skill in Tutorial 3  to acquire the ability to add more objectives, such as minimize cost.
